Hello Unity Team!

This is portable flask app that implements the /createproject and /requestproject functionalities as specified in the
specification for the Unity Coding Test for the SDET Summer Internship. This app includes unit tests, as also specified,
to test the workings of the app. It uses an ORM database (SQLAlchemy) to store data on the server. Also in this folder
contains a picture of the ER (Entity Relationship) diagram for the database backend.

This was my first time working with Flask and SQLAlchemy and as a result of doing this coding test I learned much about the
inner workings of both of the extensions. It was a fun and exploratory task and has piqued my own interest in making RESTful
application within python. I'm sure to revisit this code when I have the time.

I value feedback tremendously! After a review of this application and its code, I would appreciate any feedback on code structure, style
, conventions, or techniques that I could benefit from integrating into my own habits. Resources, articles, and other tutorials would also
be appreciated.

Unfortunately, I couldn't spend as much time as I wanted to ironingout certain issues due to midterms and 
school projects (~8 hours, learning framework and implementing it).

I hope to hear back from the Unity team,
Monish Gupta
